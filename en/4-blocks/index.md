### Merkle trees
Most blockchains, NEO included, use Merkle trees to efficiently secure the transactions contained in each block.

As Merkle roots are found in the block headers on NEO, it is recommended to familiarize yourself with Merkle trees before reading about the structure of blocks on NEO. An introduction to Merkle trees may be found [here](2a-Merkle-Tree.md).
